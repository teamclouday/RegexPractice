## About this repo  
------
I made this program intending to practice Regex easily.  
Also, this is one of the original programs(WPF) I made using Visual Studio (not using it now). Now I'm using vscode.  
So I share this program on github as a record of experience  

-------  

By the way, when I was creating this program, the only programming language I know is C# and I learnt some xaml syntax. I have no idea what the other files in this folder are, such as the APP.config.  

That's why I stop using Visual Studio. It is indeed a powerful tool, but it set up everything for the coder, which is harmful to new programmers like me(I lose the chance to learn new things). Maybe in the future, after I've become sofisticated enough, I will continue using it. (Or a great need of C# programming)
